# Linear-algebra

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as linear functions such as and their representations through matrices and vector spaces. Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics.

This series of notebooks is intended to provide a Pythonic view of looking at Linear Algebra. This also serves as a foundation to the numpy operations/Linear algebra required for Machine learning.
